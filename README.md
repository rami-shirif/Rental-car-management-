# Rental Cars Manager — Firebase + Printable Contracts

A small-agency fleet/rental manager upgraded to use **Firebase Realtime Database** instead of browser-only storage.

## Included

- Firebase Realtime Database persistence for `cars` and `rentals`
- Anonymous Firebase Authentication so database rules can require an authenticated session
- Automatic car price on rental creation
- Total rental calculation: **price per day × rental days**
- Active rental countdown / overdue status
- Rental history stored in Firebase
- Printable professional rental contract
- Contract details: customer, CIN/ID, phone, vehicle, plate, rental dates, duration, price and signatures
- Responsive dashboard, fleet, rentals and availability views

## Firebase setup

The Firebase web configuration supplied for this project is already in `src/firebase.js`.

Before running the app:

1. Open Firebase Console for the `rental-cars-manager` project.
2. Go to **Authentication → Sign-in method**.
3. Enable **Anonymous** sign-in.
4. Go to **Realtime Database → Rules**.
5. Paste the contents of `database.rules.json` and publish.

The rules allow only authenticated users to read/write the app data. The app signs users in anonymously automatically.

### Important

The Firebase web `apiKey` is not a password/secret. However, your database rules are critical. Do **not** use public `".read": true` / `".write": true` rules in production.

## Run locally

Install Node.js, then:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the Vite address shown in the terminal.

## Build for deployment

```bash
npm run build
```

The production files will be generated in `dist/`.

## Printing a contract

Start a rental. The contract window opens automatically.

You can also open the contract from an active rental or rental history using **Contract → Print contract**.

The print stylesheet hides the dashboard and prints only the contract.
